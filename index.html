      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>I was born and raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are working on my car and playing soccer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a software designer, but any job in the software department would be ideal.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I still currently live in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ever since I first began using desktops and laptops I was always fascinated by how good the design of the software looked, but as I got older I got interested in how the software actually works and makes the design function. I started studying this on my own during my spare time and have now turned this into my potential career.</p>
